As for lunch options, it would be best to have a balanced meal that provides energy without weighing you down. Here are some suggestions: 

- A turkey and avocado sandwich on whole wheat bread, with a side salad or fruit
- A grilled chicken salad with mixed greens, veggies, nuts, and dressing on the side
- A veggie stir-fry with brown rice and tofu or chicken
- A whole-grain pasta salad with veggies and chicken 

Do any of these sound appealing to you?
